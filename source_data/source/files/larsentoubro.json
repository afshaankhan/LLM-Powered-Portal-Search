By integrating NMS with the GIS, faulty cameras can be identi\ufb01ed when displayed on GIS maps with geographic perspectives along with the details of the fault. Likewise, integration of VTMS with GIS will support the dispatching team to rectify the faulty cameras and other assets by implementing routing analysis and Geo-fencing concepts.\nAll rights reserved.\nOur Businesses\nL&T-SuFin\nL&T Valves Limited\nL&T Skill Trainers Academy\nSustainable Development Goals\nVision\nInvestors\nL&T Kuwait Construction\nTwitter\nare being used at the dedicated freight corridor sites.

The orders comprise a cumulative floating solar capacity of more than 150 MWac, in addition to a ground-mounted Solar PV of 120 MWac capacity. Floating Solar projects involve mounting solar modules on structures that float in a water body, typically a reservoir/ lake/ abandoned quarry. Compared to ground-mounted solar plants, floating solar plants do not require land acquisition and typically involve less civil works. There are other site-specific merits too, besides reduction of water evaporation.\nInvestors\nL&T Kuwait Construction\nBusiness has secured another order in the State of Kuwait to build a 400kV Gas Insulated Substation. This substation will be instrumental in powering the residential clusters being developed as part of South Sabah Al-Ahmad City project.\nCorporate Social Responsibility\nIntegrated Report\nYou are using an outdated browser.

The contract documents were exchanged between Shri Arun T Ramchandani, Executive Vice President and Head-L&T Defence and Shri. PT Rojatkar, Director - Naval Materials Research Laboratory (NMRL) in the presence of Shri J D Patil, Member of Executive Committee of Management and Advisor (Defence & Smart Technologies) to CEO & MD Larsen & Toubro Limited & Senior officials from NMRL and L&T.\nThese Modules constitute the core of the fuel cell based AIP System, indigenously developed by Naval Materials Research Laboratory (NMRL) of DRDO with L&T as prime industry partner, an association spanning more than a decade. The Energy Modules (EMs) comprising Fuel Cells produce the required power, along with on-board Hydrogen generation. The technology of this indigenous AIP system is a unique one that generates hydrogen on demand thereby obviating the need for carrying hydrogen onboard which is a major safety concern for a submarine. On realisation and integration of these modules in the submarines, India will join an elite club of a handful of nations who have indigenously developed fuel cell based submarine AIP technology which is critical for increasing the endurance of conventional submarines. It is pertinent to mention here that principally this technology is a green one since the by-product of the reaction is non-polluted water which can be released into the oceans.\nThanks for sharing!\nL&T Construction & Mining Machinery\nThis project would pave the way for order(s) for AIP Systems for the remaining five Kalvari Class submarines in the coming years. This could also open up possible export opportunities to other countries that operate Scorpene class submarines.\nL&T-MHI Power Turbine Generators\nL&T Realty\nRenew: Career Re-entry for Women\nPress Releases\nDiversity, Equity & Inclusion",

As plant sizes went up, the equipment sizes and weights also increased. While manufacturing capability kept pace with these developments and state-of-the-art machinery was available to manufacture large equipment in a single piece, most of the Process Plants were located in the interiors geographically, hence it was not feasible to transport these over dimensional equipment in a single piece.
