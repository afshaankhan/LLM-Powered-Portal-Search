    "https://www.tejasnetworks.com/resource/post-pandemic-growth-pains-pave-the-way-for-next-gen-network-services/": "The decadal shift in the technological landscape is also transforming the services landscape, paving the way for next-generation services and resilient networks operations in the post Covid era. Remote Deployment Support, Remote NOC Management and Predictive Maintenance are fast becoming a reality, and are very much here to stay. The author, Ranajit Hajra, is the Executive Vice President, Head of Global Services & Customer Support at Tejas Networks. The article was published in CEO Insights Magazine. AI-enabled predictive maintenance pre-empts the network faults using advanced analytics and unified NMS. Covid-19 has accelerated the trend of deploying advanced software tools and capabilities to enable \u2018guided automation\u2019 in telecom networks. Telcos are now increasingly harnessing analytics advances to gain new insights on their networks and traffic patterns, and are considering multiple use cases that can lead to savings in capex and opex. Network analytics powered by AIOPS enables a) network capacity forecasting that ensures higher ROI through reduced over-provisioning and lower capex, b) alarm correlation and root cause analysis ensures significant reduction in false alarms and no alarm storms and c) automated health checks prevent issues, unplanned downtimes, lowering average fault resolution and remediation efforts. Faster, low latency broadband connections enabled by 4G (and 5G in future) allows faster deployment of telecom networks remotely. Innovative telecom vendors have begun delivering remote deployment and technical support to service providers and partners with AR (Augmented Reality)-enabled remote desktop to complete network deployment/ migrations in countries, which were inaccessible due to Covid19-related travel restrictions. Not only has this helped in business continuity, remote network delivery is also cost-effective as it eliminates the need for physical travel and movement of expensive resources to the sites. Advanced features such as remote camera sharing, HD VoIP (in-session voice/chat with the remote technician), highlighting on 3D objects, freeze image (pause the video to get a clear still image) etc., enable the engineering team at a central location/NOC to provide effective and efficient over-the-shoulder support to remote technicians. We expect this space to see a lot of tech-enabled action in the coming years. AR glasses to enable the local technician with real-time interactive video assistance to troubleshoot the field issues in a simulated lab environment is on the anvil. The pandemic has accelerated the need for resilient network operations and services with improved speed, quality and efficiency through real-time automation and remotisation powered by AI and analytics. These in turn would significantly impact the overall customer experience, and help ensure maximum uptime for businesses and consumers. Playing catch up is no more an option. Being future ready, today is the only way to move forward now. Remote NMS-led NOC Management Service is making the cut. The pandemic has further accelerated exploration of advanced NMS/OSS capabilities to provide NOC services to customers remotely, backed by automated provisioning, zero defect service assurance and intelligent analytics. Since network management complexity is increasing due to the fast-growing technology diversity, the need for a centralized, single-pane control is emerging as a critical necessity. NMS with multi-technology support (SDH, DWDM, PTN, Ethernet/IP and OTN), cross-technology/vendor agnostic with centralized/single pane control, and simplified views that support advanced forensics-based simultaneous SLA confirmation for multiple flows are some of the noted developments in this space. The high reliance on data has made telecom networks mission-critical and led to a sharp rise in data traffic across the world. With homes morphing into workplaces, entertainment zones, shopping malls, social networking and schools, there\u2019s been a marked increase in data consumption and greater use of high-speed broadband, both mobile and fixed. In India, data shared by the telecom regulator highlights how the average monthly wireless data consumption per user is expected to go up by around 15 per cent in the next six months. That in the first week of lockdown last year, social media usage was up by 87 per cent and internet browsing was up by 72 per cent may help put the data demand uptick in perspective. Capacity demand during that one week is what we saw in the whole of the previous year! Even as businesses stabilize and the economy begins to revive, industry analysts believe that the current network infrastructure isn\u2019t really best equipped to deal with any sudden nation-wide spikes in web traffic due to low fiberisation. A higher spending in Optical and xPON (for FTTX) led by an increase in residential bandwidth demand and significant bandwidth upgrades, therefore, can be expected in access and backbone networks, even as fiberisation continue to increase. In addition, telcos are expected to continue investing in their existing 4G networks even as they prepare their networks for 5G. The pandemic has reset the way we live, work and do business, and not surprisingly, some of these changes are here to stay. Crisis is the mother of invention, it is said; the Covid-19 crises has pushed the world to rethink, reinvent and renovate at a hitherto unknown pace. From innovative ways to work from home to \u2018zero contact\u2019 sales and \u2018zero contact\u2019 deliveries, if there is one thing that forms the backbone of all the innovation, it is data! Data is the new visa, unhindered by physical borders, universal and ubiquitous.",

Corporate Social Responsibility The Government of India introduced the BharatNet Project to provide broadband connectivity to around 2.5 lakh gram panchayats in the country. Executed in phases, so far, over 1.54 lakh gram panchayats have been made service ready with broadband infrastructure. BharatNet \u2013 World's Largest Greenfield Rural Broadband Project The project was done with tight budgets while ensuring largest coverage with minimum investments. From using scalable FTTX infrastructure, optimal use of fiber, satellite, and wireless, re-using existing public-utility assets to minimizing capital investments and commissioning ruggedised and easy-to-maintain enclosures in remote areas with a centralised Network Management System for remote configuring and monitoring, no step was overlooked or underachieved. Tejas Networks was honoured to be a part of this prestigious project and supplied a majority of the OLT and ONT used in the project. India, as a result, enjoys among the lowest cost of internet per GB. On an average, India incurred just about $20 broadband infrastructure cost/subscriber for rural broadband coverage vis-\u00e0-vis some of the developed nations that spent ~20-25 times that. ESG Direct To Mobile Broadcast solution Wi-Fi at Railway Stations The Government also smartly leveraged the established presence and reach of Indian Railways, the largest public transporter in the nation, and made Wi-Fi available at more than 5,950 stations in the country. Tejas Networks played a pivotal role in providing the FTTX and Wi-Fi equipment used in this important project. Smart Cities The Smart Cities initiative is yet another piece that will enable the realisation of the \u2018Digital India\u2019. Not only will these \u2018Smart Cities\u2019 boast of a strong connectivity infrastructure, they will enable tech-led interventions, governance initiatives, boost local economy and provide a platform for inter-agency collaboration. Focus on Applications and Citizen Services For people the world over, telecommunications has probably never been as important as it was since the global pandemic struck last year. Robust communication networks have enabled employees to work from home, students to learn from home and Governments to offer citizen services in a digital form. There has been an unprecedented rise in applications such as videoconferencing, video streaming, telemedicine, e-schools, e-commerce etc. What's more, digital connectivity has even enabled the government to track the spread of the pandemic through applications for contact tracing and other vaccination and healthcare initiatives. India\u2019s Digital Transformation Model It is important that we credit this transition to the years of investments and planning by telecom service providers and Government of India to build a connectivity model that's inclusive, robust and scalable. The GoI initiated many ambitious projects to realise the vision of a Digital India, across urban as well as rural population. In addition to the connectivity model, significant amount of foundational software as well as user-level applications have been built, which accelerated the digitisation Way Forward Indian Government and Telcos are working to continually increase the penetration of high-speed fiber broadband in cities as well as rural areas to meet the pent up demand. The cities and local Governments need to collaborate to promptly address the Right-of-Way issues so that the rollouts can be accelerated. A robust broadband infrastructure, when combined with foundational software and user-centric applications will give the omnipresent power of the internet to all and will go a long way in its development and realise the vision of a Trillion dollar digital economy in the next five years. With more than a hundred countries looking to build their digital infrastructure, it would be worthwhile to give the India model a serious look.",

    "https://www.tejasnetworks.com/technologies/sonet-sdh/": "Synchronous Optical Network (SONET), developed in the US by the ANSI and Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH), developed in the Europe by the ITU-T are two almost identical standards for transmitting various data payloads over optical fibers at high speeds. Here, the entire network is time-synchronized tightly, which is a significant difference from the previous Plesiochronous Digital Hierarchy (PDH) standard. This synchronization significantly reduces buffering in the transmission and thus improves the data rate. The data rates for SONET/ SDH vary from 155 Mbps for OC-3/ STM-1 to 40 Gbps for OC-768/ STM-256. SONET/ SDH has well-defined frame structure and uses TDM as the underlying mechanism for multiplexing services. SONET/ SDH is still widely used across the world. Even where the core network is getting transformed into a packet core, there are a significant number of client interfaces continuing to use SONET/ SDH. Changing client services is an expensive and time-consuming affair. Circuit Emulation of SONET/ SDH is an effective strategy for network backbone modernization without impacting the client service. For long, Tejas has been a leading provider of SONET/ SDH solutions. Tejas Circuit Emulation Service (CES) cards have one of the most advanced implementations of the circuit emulation function in the industry today. As a result, with Tejas multi-purpose platforms, service providers can support SONET/ SDH in addition to multiple technologies such as PTN, OTN, DWDM on the same platforms.

    "https://www.tejasnetworks.com/press-release/?e-page-6bbccc9=12": "Tejas Networks announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended March 31, 2018. The company designs, develops, manufactures, and sells high-performance optical and data networking products used to build high-speed communication networks over optical fiber. The fundamental growth drivers of the business continue to be strong. Globally, the increased use of mobile data as well as broadband by consumers, businesses, and governments results in an increased demand for optical transmission equipment. With the expansion of 4G networks and the advent of 5G and IOT in the future, the company expects this trend to continue for the next few years. During fiscal 2018, India revenues were strong, particularly in the government sector. The international business is going through a transition, where the company saw a decline in revenues from OEM customers while increasing its focus on building direct sales. Continued investment in international direct sales is showing positive signs, as strong business momentum builds up across customers in Southeast Asia, Africa, and the USA. India will continue to lead growth with increased capex in fiber optic infrastructure by telecom operators and the execution of government projects such as Bharatnet Phase 2. However, due to the nature of the business, revenue on a quarter-on-quarter basis will continue to be lumpy. For the fiscal year 2018, the company expected its revenue growth to be around 5%. Due to delays in receiving certain large orders, the company expects its revenues for fiscal year 2018 to show a year-on-year decline. However, the company continues to see strong growth potential for its business over the next few years, especially from customers in India, driven by the exponential growth in data traffic and robust capex investments on broadband infrastructure. Given its healthy order pipeline and strong business momentum, the company is well set for strong revenue and profitability growth for the coming fiscal year. Tejas Networks announced that it has implemented a high-capacity 100G DWDM network for MCM Telecom in Mexico. MCM Telecom is a premier enterprise service provider offering corporate internet, unified communications, dedicated links, data center, and hybrid cloud services. Mr. Mark Hilton, COO of MCM Telecom, said, \"As a premier provider of telecommunication services to businesses in Mexico, we seek to partner with vendors offering cutting-edge technology solutions to evolve our state-of-the-art networks and deliver new high-value service offerings. After evaluating multiple equipment vendors, we picked Tejas Networks for both our Metro and Inter-city optical network rollouts across Mexico. Tejas has an innovative Converged Packet Optical (CPO) portfolio enabling the delivery of a versatile mix of resilient and high-quality MEF CE2.0 services for connectivity.\" Arnob Roy, President \u2013 Optical Products, Tejas Networks, said, \"The demand for bandwidth from enterprises is growing by leaps and bounds due to the growing adoption of cloud services and ongoing digital transformation. Tejas is emerging as a supplier of choice for new age service providers like ICOSNET due to our ability to leverage our unique software defined hardware\u2122 that enables us to reduce time to market for new products, technologies, and standards based on specific customer or market requirements.\" Tejas Networks announced that ICOSNET, one of Algeria\u2019s leading Internet Service Providers (ISP), has chosen Tejas\u2019 Converged Packet Optical (CPO) products to serve the growing demand for its high-speed Internet access and Virtual Private Network (VPN) offerings in the country. ICOSNET has deployed Tejas\u2019 TJ1400 converged broadband access and optical aggregation platform at multiple Points of Presence (POP) within Algeria, as well as in its international exchanges in London and Madrid. Mr. Ahmed Zerkouk, CTO at ICOSNET, said, \"Over the past twelve months, we have been experiencing a dramatic rise in Internet and VPN traffic in our network that is driven by a faster adoption of higher-speed Fast Ethernet and Gigabit Ethernet connections by our enterprise customers. Tejas TJ1400 CPO is an innovative product that is designed to seamlessly scale to address our escalating capacity demands in a flexible and \"pay-as-you-grow\" manner. Moreover, as an MEF-certified CE2.0 compliant product, TJ1400 is purpose-built to carry SLA-driven premium and mission-critical enterprise data traffic with carrier-class availability and performance.\" \u201cWe are pleased to partner with ICOSNET as they enter into an exciting new phase of growth in their ISP business and expand their telecom offerings in Algeria beyond enterprise services into the retail connectivity segment,\u201d said Sanjay Nayak, CEO and MD of Tejas Networks. \u201cTejas TJ1400 is a unique platform that combines high-capacity PTN/OTN-based packet optical transmission with high-speed GPON-based fiber broadband in a dense and power-efficient chassis. TJ1400 is a best-in-class product that is ideally suited for service providers like ICOSNET that operate in high-growth telecom markets since it can deliver high-quality Internet access and business connectivity services in a scalable and cost-efficient manner,\u201d he added. Tejas Networks announced that it has received a new purchase order of Rs. 336 Cr from BSNL for the expansion of BharatNet, the world\u2019s largest rural broadband project.

Growing adoption of video and digitalization of businesses is accelerating this trend and calls for advanced network solutions. Tejas offers a versatile suite of packet optical products that enable highly scalable and agile networks with low lifecycle cost of ownership, which are a perfect fit for telcos experiencing unprecedented traffic growth in their networks.\u201d Mr. Venkatesh Gadiyar, CFO said, \u201cWe made a good start to the year with strong revenue growth and increased profitability on account of higher gross margins. As a deep-technology company, we stay committed to invest in R&D, which has seen a year-on-year increase of 37% on a gross basis. We will continue to tightly manage our working capital and expect to see some improvement during the year.

The company also highlighted that its operating profit was at \u20b9 6.6 crore which was 4.2% of its revenues (net) as against 19.5% for Q1 2019. The company\u2019s profit after tax was \u20b9 5.9 crore which was a year-on-year decline of 87%. The decline in profits is primarily due to decline in revenues, coupled with the fact that a majority of its costs such as R&D, are linked to manpower and are fixed in nature. The company believes that the margins will normalise on a full year basis, with better business momentum. The company also highlighted that its cash position is comfortable with cash and cash equivalents (including investment in mutual funds) at \u20b9 231 crore as of June 30, 2019. Tejas Networks is virtually a debt-free company and expects to collect the overdue amounts and normalise its working capital cycle in near future.",

During the quarter, our overall DSO marginally improved to 277 days and excluding BSNL, our DSO improved by 24 days to 173 days, as compared to June 30, 2019. We also started to receive some amount of long-overdue payments from BSNL during the quarter. We are practically debt-free and we have a strong balance sheet to support our growth plans.\u201d For Q2, 2019, consolidated revenues (net of pass-through component sale) were \u20b9 85.1 crore which was a year-on-year decline of 58.0%. The weak revenue during the quarter was primarily due to lower revenues from India Government segment, which had a year-on-year decline of 88% for H1 ended September 30, 2019, on account of BSNL and Bharatnet. On the other hand, India-Private segment was robust and grew by 67% year-on-year for the first six months. Decline in revenues resulted in a loss after tax of \u20b9 4.4 crore for the quarter ended September 30, 2019, since a majority of costs such as R&D, are linked to manpower and are fixed in nature. Mr. Sanjay Nayak, Managing Director and CEO of Tejas Networks said, \u201cAs we anticipated, there was a decline in India Government business which is lumpy in nature, and resulted in weak Q2 revenues. Our medium term goal is to increase our international revenue contribution to at least 50% of our total and we are on track to achieve it. Despite delay in collection from BSNL, our cash position continues to be strong, which will help us to invest and achieve our medium term goals. We see strong momentum in our international business, and during the quarter we added 5 new international customers. We also closed techno-commercial discussions for 6 new international customer deals, each of which are expected to result in multi-million orders during H2 of this year.\u201d For the half year ended September 30, 2019, revenues (net of pass-through component sale) were \u20b9 241.7 crore, which was a year-on-year decline of 44.4%.

Mrs. Anandi Ramalingam, Director (Marketing) at Bharat Electronics Limited, stated that communication technology is becoming critical in defence systems and having an indigenous ecosystem is vital for long-term strategic needs.

Tejas Networks designs, develops, manufactures and sells high-performance optical and data networking products, which are used to build high-speed communication networks over optical fiber. Mr. Sanjay Nayak, Managing Director and CEO of Tejas Networks said, \u201cA large portion of our Government business is lumpy with significant fluctuations on a quarterly basis. To de-risk our business, we aim to increase our international revenue contribution to at least 50% of our total revenues in the medium term. We are continuing to make investments in international sales and recently we have hired a strong sales leader in US, which is expected to be a key market for us.\u201d The macro factors driving our business continue to be robust, as increased use of data by consumers, businesses and governments and the rollout of 5G networks is resulting in an increased demand for our optical transmission equipment. For the quarter ended June 30, 2019, our consolidated revenues (net of pass-through component sale) were \u20b9 156.6 crore which was a year-on-year decline of 32.5%. The weak revenue during the quarter was primarily due to steep decline in Government business. The Government business was 15% of revenues during the quarter as compared to 55% in Fiscal 2019. The decline is due to deferment of spending on Government projects and we expect to see enhanced Government spending during the second half of the fiscal year. Our Operating profit was at \u20b9 6.6 crore which was 4.2% of our revenues (net) as against 19.5% for Q1 2019. Our profit after tax was \u20b9 5.9 crore which was a year-on-year decline of 87%. The decline in profits is primarily due to decline in revenues, coupled with the fact that a majority of our costs such as R&D, are linked to manpower and are fixed in nature. We believe that the margins will normalise on a full year basis, with better business momentum. Mr. Venkatesh Gadiyar, CFO said, \u201cWhile our receivables days are stretched our cash position is comfortable with cash and cash equivalents (including investment in mutual funds) at \u20b9 231 crore as of June 30, 2019. We are virtually a debt-free company. We expect to collect the overdue amounts and normalise our working capital cycle in near future.\u201d During the quarter, our DSO increased to 284 days and working capital to 283 days primarily due to continued delay in collections from a PSU customer and higher revenue in the last month of the previous quarter. Investment in Research and Development (R&D) continues to be a key focus area for us. Our products have won accolades at national as well as international levels. Tejas\u2019 GPON OLT product won the prestigious \u201cNational Technology Award\u201d from Department of Science and Technology, Government of India. Our latest ultra-converged broadband access/edge product family, was the finalist at the \u201cLeading Lights Award 2019\u201d from Light Reading, USA.

The company designs, develops, manufactures, and sells high-performance optical and data networking products used to build high-speed communication networks. Tejas Networks reported a consolidated revenue (net of pass-through component sale) of Rs. 77.4 crore for Q1 2021, a YoY decline of 50.6%. The company reported a loss after tax of Rs. 9.8 crore, compared to a profit after tax of Rs. 5.9 crore in the corresponding previous period.

Tejas Networks Ltd. is a part of the Tata Group, with Panatone Finvest Ltd. (a subsidiary of Tata Sons Pvt. Ltd.) being the majority shareholder. Tejas Networks [BSE: 540595, NSE: TEJASNET] today reported its financial results for the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2020. Tejas Networks designs, develops, manufactures and sells high-performance optical and data networking products, which are used to build high-speed communication networks over optical fiber. As on date, we have filed for 349 patents and during the quarter, we were granted 3 patent bringing our cumulative grant to 116 patents. Certain statements in this release concerning our future growth prospects are forward-looking statements, which involve a number of risks, and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in such forward-looking statements due to risks or uncertainties associated with our expectations with respect to, but not limited to, our ability to successfully implement our strategy and our growth and expansion plans, technological changes, our exposure to market risks, general economic and political conditions in India which have an impact on our business activities or investments, changes in the laws and regulations that apply to the industry in which the Company operates. The Company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements that may be made from time to time by or on behalf of the Company. For the year ended March 31, 2020, revenues (net of pass-through component sale) were Rs. 379.8 crore, which was a YoY decline of 56.7%. As a result, for the year, loss before tax and before impairment of intangibles was Rs. 68.7 crore (Loss of Rs. 138.6 crore, post one-time R&D impairment charge), against a profit before tax of Rs. 150.0 crore for the corresponding period. Revenues from customers in India (which was 79% of total revenues in FY19) declined by 63% YoY and in particular, revenues from the India Government segment declined by 88% YoY. Mr. Venkatesh Gadiyar, CFO said, \u201cAs of March 31, 2020, we are a debt free Company and our cash and cash equivalents, including investment in liquid mutual funds and deposits with financial institutions, stood at Rs. 280 crore. Our receivables are at Rs. 456 crore, of which a majority is expected to be collected in FY21 and we also have inventory of Rs. 252 crore, a large part of which is expected to be shipped to customers in FY21. During FY21, we expect to improve our cash position from our current levels, based on our collection plan, inventory usage and tight operations. We have done a detailed cash flow planning for the next 12 months and believe that we are well covered to meet all our business growth requirement. Since the Company has made a loss, as per our policy, the Board has decided not to recommend any dividend this year.\u201d In the short-term, due to ever-changing COVID-19 situation, it is likely that we will have fluctuations in the Company\u2019s operations. There may be delays in customer orders and with various logistics and governmental restrictions, even the execution of orders in hand could be impacted. From a macro industry outlook, with more people working remotely and many services being accessed from homes, there has been a significant increase in data traffic in telecom networks, which will drive a demand for higher bandwidth and more optical and data transmission equipment. Our customers are expected to increase their investments to address fiber-to-the-home broadband requirements and to augment the capacity of their optical networks.\u201d Tejas Networks announces consolidated results for quarter ended March 31, 2020 Q4 revenue Rs. 52.7 crore and FY 20 revenue was Rs. 379.8 crore For Q4, 2020, consolidated revenues (net of pass-through component sale) were Rs. 52.7 crore which was a YoY decline of 80.2%. Decline in revenues resulted in a loss before tax and before impairment of intangible assets of Rs. 56.7 crore, as compared to a profit of Rs. 37.1 crore for corresponding previous period, since a majority of costs other than cost of material, are linked to manpower and are fixed in nature. The weak revenue during Q4 was primarily because of operational challenges and inability to ship confirmed customer orders because of lockdown due to Covid-19 and pushout of new customer orders, which were otherwise expected. The company also reassessed the marketability of its intangible assets under development as well as capitalized intangible assets, and has taken a one-time impairment charge of Rs. 69.87 crore towards the accumulated costs relating to past R&D. Mr. Sanjay Nayak, Managing Director and CEO of Tejas Networks said, \u201cIndian telecom sector is undergoing major financial stress, resulting in capex reduction by all private operators. In addition, Government spending on telecom projects declined sharply during FY20, resulting in a major revenue decline for us. We have put a lot of focus to reduce our dependence on India, and our medium term goal is to get 50% of our revenues from international customers. We made significant progress during FY20 in terms of securing new international customer wins and increasing our sales investments, but we could not see the positive impact in Q4, due to pushout of orders because of COVID-19.
