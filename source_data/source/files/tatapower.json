It supplies electricity to the five states of Gujarat and Maharashtra in western India and Haryana, Rajasthan, and Punjab in the north.\nDiversity Equity and Inclusion (DEI)\nPolicies\nIn 2011\n, we turned our own Mumbai office into an experiment. Atop the building, a 60.48 KWP rooftop solar panel was installed. The panels weren't just generating clean energy; they were a silent declaration that solar energy could power the very heart of a metropolis.\n, we acquired a 67.5 MW coal-based power plant in Jharkhand, named the Jojobera plant. This acquisition marked the beginning of Tata Power's expansion beyond Maharashtra.\nClub Enerji\nInvestors\nOur community values\nYears of tireless work followed.

Given this need, we proposed to the government to set up a plant at Trombay. This move forged our entry into power generation through conventional resources. Over the next four decades, various locations transformed. New units, each more powerful than the last, rose from the ground, navigating the intricate landscape with a keen eye on both energy security and environmental responsibility.\nDisclaimer\nClub enerji\nKeep reading....\nIn the early 1900s, India's industrial dreams flickered to life in the far-out hinterland of rural Maharashtra. Visionary seer Jamsetji Tata, during one of his visits to the Western Ghats, witnessed natural conduits of rainwater in the hills. It was then that, amidst the raw power of nature, the spark for Tata Power ignited. He saw in those cascading waterfalls a potential far greater than mere aesthetics\u2014a chance to harness the energy of hydroelectricity to power schools, factories, homes, and hospitals in the city of Mumbai.\nIn the 1900s, hydroelectricity relied solely on natural waterfalls. But we envisioned a grander scheme. We wanted to carve artificial reservoirs high up in the mountains that would supply water down the pipes to the powerhouses nestled below. But the terrain was unforgiving and troubled with engineering challenges.\nWho we are\nInvestor resource center\nTransmission\nuser_cookie_consent\nWind Energy\nMedia Gallery\n, a new chapter unfolded when a Pump Storage Unit in Bhira (BPSU), the largest in Asia at the time, was engineered by a team of experts to meet the city's surging electricity needs.

We are continually strengthening our green energy portfolio by actively reducing the burden of carbon generation and excessive power supply. This makes us future-ready to thrive in the energy sector and set a benchmark that inspires generations to come.\nIn 2000\nTPDDL\n\u200bIn 2020\nTPWODL\nTPSDI\nOur story started with harnessing the power of our rivers, which continues to this day. Even today we envision innovative solutions that aren't just convenient but empowering. The arrival of the smart meter is the newest buzz in innovation. Real-time cost management, which enables people to simplify bills and even prepay for electricity, just like they would with phone plans, means that confusing bills are a thing of the past. As technology gallops forward, we adapt. Tired of meter tampering? We have partnered with a tech company to develop the first groundbreaking spoof-detection logic in our smart meter reading device (SMRD). Our AI identifies fraudulent practices with hawk-like precision, enhancing protection in energy consumption for both the company and its customers.\nA vision for a hydro-powered India\nTrombay - heart of Mumbai\u2019s power supply\nEnergy as a Service\nSolar rooftop\nMedia kit\nConventional energy\nNews and Media\nAs we usher in a new era of renewable energy, we also place a high value on the coexistence of nature and intelligent technologies.

A pioneering spirit crackled in the air as we commissioned the first solar power plant in 1996, a modest 110 KW nestled amidst the scenic hills of Walwhan, Lonavla. It was a small spark, but one that re-ignited a vision for a cleaner future. Today, with 30 years of expertise, our renewables portfolio is on a meteoric rise.

As per a Niti Ayog report, the government aims to have 40% buses, 30% private cars, 70% commercial vehicles, and 80% two-wheelers to be electric by 2030. To reach the green milestone of our dreams, India requires a total of 39 lakh charging stations.\nSolaroof\nOctober 10, 2024\nHere are 5 reasons to get an EV charger for your housing society now!\nDiversity Equity and Inclusion (DEI)\nPolicies\nAs the consciousness towards eco-friendly modes of living grows, more and more people are drawn to residences that keep in mind their eco-conscious needs. Societies with solar rooftop setups, groundwater recycling, and lush parks are appreciated. The prolific need for EV charging stations, and the lack thereof in the country, motivates a lot of environment-loving people to move to housing communities with these charging points.\nHaving an EV charger available in your society instead of your home takes away a lot of hassle\u2014you no longer have to worry about maintenance or costs (however low they may be).\nClub Enerji\nInvestors\nConvenience for EV owners\nOur community values\n/\nOur leadership\nEZ Home\nEnergy solutions\nHydro Energy\nAs EVs continue to take over, range anxiety continues to persist. To that effect, a lot of people prefer that they recharge their car before stepping out. This is where having a charging point close by comes in handy. Mumbai, a city with 1,000 charging points for instance, has 385 points in residential societies alone. Tata Power has taken it upon themselves to equip Maharashtra with an additional 4,000 points. Needless to say, EV charging points are taking over the market for good.\nSolar Energy\nOur latest updates\nHere\u2019s why EVs are good for the environment\nView all\nBLOG\nTPNODL\nDisclaimer\nClub enerji\nWho we are\nInvestor resource center\nTransmission\nWhile this is happening, residential societies still find themselves hesitant over setting up a charging station. One of the main concerns is whether there is sufficient demand. Between April 2023 and March 2024, India witnessed the sale of 1.66 million EVs! This will only catapult demand for EV charging points.\nuser_cookie_consent\nWind Energy\nMedia Gallery\nOur legacy\nMedia gallery\nDEI\nSun Powered Savings : Unveiling the advantages of solar energy\nWith the entourage of people owning an EV becoming heavier, it would be utterly beneficial for housing societies to chime in on this opportunity. A common charging station not only creates a sense of sustainable community and fosters shared responsibility among people, it also benefits the residential societies in more ways than one.\nEV charging stations can become a great source of revenue for housing society associations like RWAs in various areas. The station can be setup by pooling the resources of all the residents, and the service be disbursed at a constant rate. This can help avoid fluctuations that usually occur in the case of public and semi-public stations.\nReduction in carbon footprint\nTPDDL\nGone are the days when you spotted one green numberplate among a thousand white ones. These green plate EVs are all the rage now. India has finally jumped over the hurdles of owning an EV; but with just a little over 16,000 EV charging stations in the country, we have a long way to go.\nTPWODL\nTPSDI\nA lot of societies worry that the wholesome end needs a worrisome experience. But if you\u2019re in the right hands, your EV future will be bright and green as ever. Resorting to reliable resources and field experts can help curb your tensions. Tata Power for instance, has deployed over 62,000 chargers across the country. With their round-the-clock support and exceptional after-sales services, you can be relieved of all your stress.\nEven for people with hybrid EVs, recharging them at home becomes a more convenient option than using traditional polluting fuels like petrol and diesel. Installing EV chargers at home can thereby contribute to the overall reduction in carbon footprint in a particular area.\nEnergy as a Service\nSolar rooftop\nMedia kit\nConventional energy\nNews and Media\nThermal Energy\nEthics\nSitemap\nFeatured Stories\nUNSDG alignment\nEnergy Services\nRevenue generation\nEV Charging For Housing Society\nFeatured stories\nSocieties with a greater number of EVs tend to have lower levels of sound and air pollution, thereby becoming a healthier abode for children and adults alike.\nRelated Websites\nDecline\nRenewables\nCareer compass\nCorporate governance\nNews & Media\nto setup an EV charging\nIOT & Automation\nHaving an EV charger at one's housing society is a source of great joy to EV owners.

Additionally, such societies attract more residents, in turn leading to a boom in businesses in the area. The availability of such facilities means the property becomes a hot-selling cake on the market. So once the cycle is set in motion, there is growth on all ends.\nSustainability resource center\nSustainable governance\nSolar energy\nTPSODL\nQuick Search\nCommunity values\nMedia releases\nInnovation hub\nWind energy\nEnergy as a service\nprivacy policy\nEmployee volunteering\nWhile highways, malls, hotels, and offices are quickly taking the EV route, housing societies aren\u2019t jumping on the trend as quickly.

The signs of autism begin during early childhood (usually before the age of 3) and have a significant impact on the individual\u2019s development as an adult too. Since autism is a spectral disorder, children and adults with autism can show symptoms in any degree of severity. So, two individuals with the same diagnoses may present very differently.\nSustainable governance\nSolar energy\nThe Impact of Screen Time on Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder\nTPSODL\nQuick Search\nCommunity values\nMedia releases\nInnovation hub\nThe Power of Art and Craft: Enhancing Development and Well-being in Children with Autism\nTata Power enhances e-mobility across Eastern UP\nWind energy\nEnergy as a service\nBeing a Good Communication Model for Your Child\nDr. Azizuddin Khan\nDilshad Mehershahi\nprivacy policy\nEmployee volunteering\nBuilding Independence: Mastering Instrumental Activities of Daily Living in Adolescence\nMaharashtra Neurodiversity Summit\nSpecialist in programme design for different intervention programmes for persons with neurodiversity Years of work experience: 25 years in inclusion and special needs\nHuman rights\nOur story\nPay Autention | Slice of Life: Role of Technology in the Lives of Professionals with Disability\nMotor Development in Children with Autism: Fostering Gross Motor and Fine Motor Skills\nNational Roundtable Conference on Neurodiversity",

This initiative expanded to Delhi, Gujarat, and Jharkhand, and during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Trombay CSR team unified over 250 community women into the Saheli Mahila Bachat Gat federation. Recognizing the power of collective action, we launched the Anokha Dhaaga program in January 2021 to support the livelihoods of self-help groups. Since then, we have provided opportunities for over 500 women from slum localities to develop skills and gain employment\nAt Anokha Dhaaga, we are dedicated to transforming lives by empowering women through collective action and skill development\nThrough our Anokha Dhaaga center, we supplied over 3.5 lakh certified filtered masks during the pandemic, generating 67 lakhs in revenue. We also completed significant B2B orders, including 27,000 handicraft decoratives for Amazon Inc. and 5,000 haversack bags for the Mumbai Marathon by TCS. Our training programs span various product lines such as apparel, home decor, and corporate gifting, creating diverse income opportunities for women. In FY 24, we generated 56 lakhs from 91 B2B orders and organized 21 exhibitions, partnering with multiple livelihood platforms for long-term support and growth\nEnergy Services\nAnokha Dhaaga is a beacon of hope and opportunity, uplifting women with dignity, skill, and the promise of a brighter future.

These have progressively started falling year on year instead of increasing. This means that the Mahseer population is growing organically. Rivers and lakes that were once bereft of the Mahseer are now teeming with them after hatchlings introduced from the Walvan hatchery have started breeding and increasing. Mahseer are also now being increasingly sighted at various points by avid Anglers. However the Golden Mahseer is still not off the red list and Tata Power will only believe its mission is accomplished when this is achieved.\nTPCODL\nOur website uses cookies to enhance your browsing experience.

All Rights Reserved\nSustainable resource center\nTENDERS\nWe have been conducting various activities for youngsters under our Club Enerji initiative. These include excursions that raise awareness about the gorgeous Mahseer. The idea is to encourage children to learn about an important aspect of their ecology, while also initiating the slightly older kids into enjoying the sport of fishing the Mahseer, and then letting it back into the water. Letting the fish back into the water also teaches them important lessons of life, of letting go, of not trying to possess more than is required, of maintaining a balance with nature, and making peace with it.\nTata Power has developed an ingenious method to breed 4-5 lakh Mahseer hatchlings at a time at its Walvan Hatchery in Lonavala, by creating a huge lake while damming the Indrayani river. It is here that the Blue-Finned and Golden species of Mahseer congregate, attracted by the sound of the highly oxygenated water in the lake.\nInvestor resource center\nAffirmative action and inclusivity\nopens in a new tab\nAccept\nreading...\nMedia Kit\nDistribution\nAlso, the current pandemic has taught us that by hunting animals and indiscriminate fishing, we are destroying entire habitats and eco-systems. Thus making it easier for diseases to spread from one animal or bird or fish to another, and then spill over onto humans.\nTPADL\nArpan\nTata Power Solar\nThere is quite a quaint story as to how Tata Power wholeheartedly got immersed in Mahseer conservation. Apparently, the locals living in the villages in rural Maharashtra would worship the Mahseer as a god-fish because it sports a barble above its mouth that resembles a \u2018nathini\u2019 worn by a woman. These locals began noticing the dwindling of the Mahseer and then to their dismay, its absolute disappearance. Not knowing whom to turn to, they approached the Fisheries Department for help. The Department in turn enlisted Tata Power for support, since it had its plant in the area and was seen as a corporate that could make a difference.\nWhat we do\nInstagram -\nSolaroof\nOctober 10, 2024\nThat was when we at Tata Power decided to step in, exactly fifty years ago. Just in the nick of time. For a fish that was literally feeling out of water!\nDiversity Equity and Inclusion (DEI)\nPolicies\nInvestors\nMaking \u2018Act For Mahseer\u2019 as crucial as save the tiger\nOur community values\nAfter carefully analysing and understanding the situation, a Mahseer Breeding Centre was set up in conjunction with the Central Institute of Fisheries Education near Tata Power\u2019s Walwan Dam project at Lonavala, Maharashtra. Concentrating especially on the Blue-Finned and the top-of-the-pops Golden Mahseer. For the last 50 years, the Centre has offered unstinted support, ideas and innovation to increase the numbers of this precious species.\nTata Power is proud to recount the efforts of these Mahseer champions who have gone about their work in an understated manner and without ever fishing for compliments.\nOur leadership\nOnce the eggs are fertilised, (over the last 50 years there have been 15 million of them), the baby hatchlings emerge within 72-96 hours. And at the end of 4-6 months they are ready to be handed over to various fisheries departments across the country, who in turn introduce them into lakes and rivers in their states. This too is a very careful and well-coordinated effort between Tata Power and the Fisheries Departments and over the years has resulted in some 11.6 million hatchlings making their homes in waters all over India and growing into awe-inspiring specimens that can measure up to 9 feet long weigh up to 33 kilograms!\nEZ Home\nEnergy solutions\nHydro Energy\nIt follows then, that conserving the Mahseer, increasing its numbers, and getting it off the IUCN red list is even more important today than ever before\nSolar Energy\nOur latest updates\nLet\u2019s all swim with the Mahseer\nAs part of their visits to the Walvan hatchery most children handle a live (and in fact live-wire) fish for the very first time. Some of them have been known to exclaim \u2018why do we eat such a beautiful fish?\u2019 When they realise that water pollution leads to a dwindling of the Mahseer, they start discussing ideas to keep the rivers pollution free. They easily fall in love with this energetic fish and quite a few of them want to visit their new-found friends again.\nView all\nTPNODL\nThis unique fish is very sensitive to dissolved oxygen levels, water temperature and sudden climatic changes. It just cannot bear pollution. It is thus an important indicator of fresh water.\nDisclaimer\nWe look forward to all of us in Tata Power as well as in the rest of the Group joining in as many of these activities as possible and making them a success with our energy and enthusiasm.

The Green Climate Fund Readiness Programme and various public-private partnerships together aim to leverage finance and technical capability for green projects in India.\nEthics\nSitemap\nFeatured Stories\nUNSDG alignment\nEnergy Services\nGreen loans are used to finance projects that care to prevent environmental issues such as climate change, soil pollution, natural resources depletion, the loss of biodiversity, and many others. Borrowers are obliged to report on the usage of such funds, including the impact of funds spent, like emission reduction, energy saved or produced, etc. Banks and PFIs provide green loans at concessional terms and have lower interest rates and terms compared to the market terms.
