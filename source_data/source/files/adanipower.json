To address this risk, we have created enough water storage capacity at our Tiroda and Kawai power plants.\nL&D\nRaipur, Chhattisgarh\n\u00d7\nSingrauli, Madhya Pradesh\n\"Contact Us\nExplore Newsroom\nLegal Disclaimer\nClimate change mitigation and adaptation strategy\nExtreme weather events such as strong and frequent storms can adversely affect the supply of fuel and damage generation and grid infrastructure. To combat these aspects, we have designed and built all power plants and infrastructure to withstand cyclones of up to 198 kmph.\nWe were the first in India to commission supercritical boilers, which save about 2% of fuel per unit of power generated and help in subsequent reduction in GHGs per unit. In the future, we are considering utilising ultra-supercritical units for upcoming TPPs to further reduce specific GHG emission. Till date, we have commissioned 7,920 MW (12 units of 660 MW each) of power plants based on supercritical technology. To adapt to the increase in water temperatures due to climate change in the future, all our thermal power plants are equipped with induced draft cooling towers with a re-circulation system.\n\"Sustainability\nBitta, Gujarat\nOccupational Health and Safety\n\u00a9 2022 Adani Group\nExplore Operational Power Plants\nSocial Media\nCommercials\nNewsroom\nJob Openings\nExplore Sustainability\nMedia Releases\nEmission Management\nOccupational Health & Safety\nWaste Management\nArchives\nTiroda, Maharashtra\nChanges in the precipitation rates may affect water availability in our hinterland power plants at Tiroda and Kawai. To mitigate the risk of reduced water availability, we have implemented suitable water conservation and recycling practices, including rainwater harvesting and increasing the green belt cover.\nWater Management\nBoard of Directors\nExplore About Us\nWith respect to the rising sea levels and cyclonic surges due to global warming, the finished floor level of the Mundra power plant has been raised to 10 m above the Chart Datum (CD), the lowest astronomical tides and mean low water, whereas the highest high tide recorded is 5.4 m above the CD.\nChairman Message\nMundra, Gujarat\nKey Management Personnel\nThis will help in maintaining the desired temperature difference across the condenser and maintain plant efficiency over time. To combat any increase in air temperature, all our power plants that are located in tropical climatic zones are designed to perform under extreme temperatures.",

Moist conditions are maintained in the ash pond surface to prevent fugitive emissions. In Tiroda (Maharashtra), we have installed a High Concentration Slurry Disposal (HCSD) system for ash disposal, where the ash gets solidified immediately. There has been a lot of focus by the Central Government on ash utilisation from power plants.\nWe have therefore developed infrastructure to handle and enable us to sell fly ash. This has helped us increase our ash utilisation supply to specialised agencies for use in cement manufacturing.\nAsh utilisation is a major challenge at Tiroda due to its geographical location as all the cement plants are at a distance of more than 250 km.

    "https://www.adanipower.com/about-us/chairman-message": "The Power to Overcome:\n\u201cthe capability of a strained body to recover its size and shape after\nResilient Group Performance\nOur #HeroesAtWork\nAbout Us\nPrivacy Policy\nWaste Management\nOver the last decade, India\u2019s power demand has grown at an average annual rate of 4.5%, which is slower than its GDP growth rate. This dichotomy is explained by the preponderance of the service sector led growth and the fact that vast swathes of the population were not connected to power grids. On the other hand, energy and peak deficits, which were unsustainably high at 10% and 12.7% respectively in FY 2009-10 have come down to 0.5% and 0.7% respectively in FY 2019-20. The removal of this hurdle, which held back India\u2019s economic growth and the well-being of its people for decades, was possible only with the contribution of the private sector in generation capacity growth, aided by various supportive policies of the Government and we have had the opportunity to have played a significant role as the largest private power producer in the country.\n\"Businesses\nThe Possibilities:\nOperational Power Plants\nInvestor Downloads\nWhile we are looking at disruption to economic activity caused by the impact of an elongated lockdown in the post COVID-19 world, the realisation that our nation must grasp an emerging, one time opportunity to strengthen its industrial base by increasing its self-reliance from domestic manufacturing as well as by attracting investments into export-oriented, high value-added sectors could be a potential game changer in accelerating the demand for power.\nThe Webster definition of resilience is\nExplore Upcoming Power Plants\nchairman message\nTerms & Conditions\nHome\nKawai, Rajasthan\ncaused especially by compressive stress\u201d\nAt times like this one looks for inspiration. In this context Wayne Muller, a well-known author, writes that for thousands of years humankind has suffered famine, war, plague, hunger, and countless injustices; it has experienced numberless births and deaths. Each community of people has had to find some way to speak about what sustained them or brought them grace\u2014even in the midst of terrible sorrow. We have struggled to name this human trait, the universal force that makes the grass improbably push its way through concrete, the force that turns the earth, the energy that we seem to possess and blesses all life, the essential presence in our deepest nature that can never be spoken of with perfect accuracy but yet make us what we are. History is one big story of human overcoming. It\u2019s what we are born to do.\nGroup\u2019s Sustainability Journey:\nUdupi, Karnataka\nSitting where we are today, I can say that history is in process of being scripted. I will be the first to admit that I have no way of predicting the short or mid-term possible economic outcomes as a result of Covid-19. However, there cannot be any denying the fact that India over the next several decades will be a market continuously on the up and one that simply cannot be ignored. It will be one of the world\u2019s top consumption centers, manufacturing and service hubs and a beacon of stable democratic governance. If there was a time to make a bet on India, there may not be a better time than now. What I can predict is that on the other side of this crisis will emerge massive new opportunities, will emerge great new leaders, will emerge terrific businesses, and will emerge a few stronger nations. Those that succeed will be the ones that understand that resilience is built on the other side of the tunnel of crisis and we are already getting ready for this.\nIn times such as this the spirit and compassion of our people reinstates my belief in our core philosophy of Growth with Goodness. Let all of us contribute to help our nation rise above this crisis. It may take time but there is ample optimism to show that it is possible.\nBoard And Committee Charters\nMedia Coverage\nSustainability\nExplore Investor Relations\nAny shock to a system always helps drive home some key points and what the Indian businesses have learnt over the past few years and most certainly post Covid 19 is the value of an optimal and perhaps for some sectors a conservative capital structure as well as the criticality to have systematic risk mitigation plans in place. Both optimal capital structures, and risk mitigation is a part of the maturing of the business philosophies as they grow in size and lays the foundation for stability as well as consistent value creation.\nMedia Library\nExplore Careers\n+ View All\nSiteMap\n\"Newsroom\nInvestors\n\"Investors\nAdani Foundation contributed Rs. 5 crore to the Gujarat CM-Relief Fund and Rs. 1 crore to the Maharashtra CM Relief Fund; we have also contributed to Kattupalli District Collector COVID-19 Fund and the Bhadra District Administration.\nAt the Group level, our focus is on optimising capital utilisation, redesigning the organisational structure to minimise risk in our businesses and funding operations in phases. I am happy to share that during the year, the Group has been able to bring strategic global equity partners in Adani Gas, Adani Green Energy Ltd and Adani Mumbai Electricity Ltd. The total investment is USD 1.6 bn; and will help drive future growth of our businesses. It is also pertinent to mention that AEML (part of Adani Transmission) recently completed an investment grade, USD 1 billion bond issuance, the first by a private integrated utility from India. The issue generated significant interest from international investors and was oversubscribed by 5.9 times. I must also mention here that APSEZ raised $750 million by selling overseas bonds, the proceeds from which would be used for fund expansion and further reduce the cost of debt and progressively further deleverage the balance sheet. In the preceding 12 months, the Group has successfully placed seven bonds in the international markets, totaling to 4.26 bn USD.\nWhat we must realize is that there are no absolute right or wrong ideas. What is required during an unprecedented, hard to model, crisis like Covid-19, is a Government that is willing to make decisions based on best available information at a given point of time and constantly adapting as new information becomes available. For this, the Indian Government and bureaucracy must be complimented. Countries with greater resources than ours have struggled and while our battle with the virus is far from over, I have no hesitation in stating that had the decisions that got made been delayed we could have been facing an unmitigated disaster that would not just impact India but have global ramifications. Yes, business has suffered immensely, lives and jobs have been lost, and the migrant worker crisis saddened the entire nation, but the consequences of the unknown alternates would be far grimmer. What the leaders of our nation, the doctors, the healthcare workers, the police, the army, the small street side vendors, and the citizens have done to support each other is truly what defines India and its resiliency. Add to this the fact that the Government is are now able to do direct benefits transfer as a result of the integrated approach it has built through the Jan Dhan, Aadhaar and Mobile linking systems and we start seeing the benefits of a Government that had the vision to put in place the infrastructure we need to be able to handle a crisis.\n\"About Us\nOur journey towards sustainability accelerated over the past 12 months. We are now leading the clean energy transformation taking place not just in India but globally, and our Group is building one of the largest integrated energy portfolios. Our vision is to become the world\u2019s largest solar power company by FY25, and the largest renewable power company by FY30. I must mention here that our Group and TOTAL signed definitive agreements to deepen our existing partnership and commitment for developing multi-energy offerings for the Indian energy market. We are fully committed to supporting our nation in diversifying its energy mix through partnerships in natural gas and solar energy.\nGodda, Jharkhand\nOccupational Health Safety\nGautam Adani\nClimate Change Mitigation and Adaptation Strategy\n\"Careers\nInvestor FAQs\nDisclosure 62 Of SEBI (LODR) Regulations\nabout us\nDisclosure 46 Of SEBI (LODR) Regulations\nGujarat Adani Institute of Medical Sciences (GAIMS) is the only hospital equipped for handling COVID-19 cases in Kutch, India's largest district.\nRaigarh, Chhattisgarh\nCorporate Governance and Statutory Disclosures\nL&D\nEmission Management\nRaipur, Chhattisgarh\ndeformation\n\u00d7\nAs one of the fastest growing renewable energy groups in the world, we fully recognize that the intermittency of solar and wind generation preclude their displacing thermal power as the mainstay of India\u2019s demand-driven power needs.

Our Foundation has contributed Rs. 100 crore to the Prime Minister\u2019s Citizen Assistance and Relief in Emergency Situations Fund (PM CARES Fund). I am equally grateful to our workforce in India for contributing Rs. 4 crore for the battle against COVID-19. It is because of the solidarity demonstrated by this workforce of over 17,000 people that our Foundation could add another Rs. 4 crore, collectively contributing another Rs. 8 crore towards COVID-19 relief projects in India. As a responsible corporate, we will continue to stand by the nation in various capacities in this hour of need. On that note, I must also take this opportunity to thank our teams for the following measures:\nTherefore, it is not a trade off as much as it is giving an entire segment of our population that needs affordable power a fair chance to be better integrated into the society. We have been at the forefront of the Adani Group\u2019s efforts to provide the motive force of electricity to make this happen as well as help drive India\u2019s economic growth engine. We have also strengthened our competitive position by implementing expansion through both organic and inorganic means. Our efforts to improve regulatory certainty of our operations and enhance visibility of future earnings are starting to bring fruit, and we have started receiving long awaited regulatory payments. In addition, we have continued to put in place world class capabilities as well as monitoring facilities that ensure our power plants are world class in terms of emissions as well as efficiencies. While we have had challenges, over the next two years, we expect to fully realize the outcome of these efforts and I am confident of seeing us transform into a financially stable, and profitable organisation.\n\"Sustainability\nWomen cooperatives aided by Adani Saksham produced more than 1.2 lakh masks to help economically disadvantaged sections of the population.\nBitta, Gujarat\nConserving Biodiversity\nThe Foundation is also contributing to the CM-Relief Funds of many other states such as Kerala, Jharkhand, Andhra Pradesh.\nOccupational Health and Safety\n\u00a9 2022 Adani Group\nExplore Operational Power Plants\nAdani Power Continues to Execute on its Strategy:\nSocial Media\nCommercials\nNewsroom\nEconomic Measures - A Significant Opportunity:\nCommunities\nJob Openings\nExplore Sustainability\nMedia Releases\nVarious economic reforms, which have been announced recently to get the economy jumpstarted, makes me optimistic about the possibilities.

The renewable energy transition continues to accelerate, and the focus should be on doing this as cleanly as possible given the technologies that are now available. India is the only major nation that is ahead of its commitments made under COP 21 at Paris in 2015. As a growing major economy, it needs to utilize all sources of energy to reach its development goals. India is expected to achieve two of the three commitments made under the Paris Agreement, viz. reducing GHG emission intensity, increasing penetration of renewables, and creating an additional carbon sink in the form of green cover, a full decade before the 2030 deadline.\nI am pleased to report that each one of our six publicly traded companies has performed well even as we started to confront the trying circumstances following the first few weeks of 2020. While we may have to do need-based course correction in our strategies in the wake of the challenge that we are facing, the roadmap remains clear.

This dichotomy is explained by the preponderance of the service sector led growth and the fact that vast swathes of the population were not connected to power grids. On the other hand, energy and peak deficits, which were unsustainably high at 10% and 12.7% respectively in FY 2009-10 have come down to 0.5% and 0.7% respectively in FY 2019-20. The removal of this hurdle, which held back India\u2019s economic growth and the well-being of its people for decades, was possible only with the contribution of the private sector in generation capacity growth, aided by various supportive policies of the Government and we have had the opportunity to have played a significant role as the largest private power producer in the country.\n\"Businesses\nThe Possibilities:\nOperational Power Plants\nInvestor Downloads\nWhile we are looking at disruption to economic activity caused by the impact of an elongated lockdown in the post COVID-19 world, the realisation that our nation must grasp an emerging, one time opportunity to strengthen its industrial base by increasing its self-reliance from domestic manufacturing as well as by attracting investments into export-oriented, high value-added sectors could be a potential game changer in accelerating the demand for power.\nThe Webster definition of resilience is\nExplore Upcoming Power Plants\nchairman message\nTerms & Conditions\nHome\nKawai, Rajasthan\ncaused especially by compressive stress\u201d\nAt times like this one looks for inspiration. In this context Wayne Muller, a well-known author, writes that for thousands of years humankind has suffered famine, war, plague, hunger, and countless injustices; it has experienced numberless births and deaths. Each community of people has had to find some way to speak about what sustained them or brought them grace\u2014even in the midst of terrible sorrow. We have struggled to name this human trait, the universal force that makes the grass improbably push its way through concrete, the force that turns the earth, the energy that we seem to possess and blesses all life, the essential presence in our deepest nature that can never be spoken of with perfect accuracy but yet make us what we are. History is one big story of human overcoming. It\u2019s what we are born to do.\nGroup\u2019s Sustainability Journey:\nUdupi, Karnataka\nSitting where we are today, I can say that history is in process of being scripted. I will be the first to admit that I have no way of predicting the short or mid-term possible economic outcomes as a result of Covid-19. However, there cannot be any denying the fact that India over the next several decades will be a market continuously on the up and one that simply cannot be ignored. It will be one of the world\u2019s top consumption centers, manufacturing and service hubs and a beacon of stable democratic governance. If there was a time to make a bet on India, there may not be a better time than now. What I can predict is that on the other side of this crisis will emerge massive new opportunities, will emerge great new leaders, will emerge terrific businesses, and will emerge a few stronger nations. Those that succeed will be the ones that understand that resilience is built on the other side of the tunnel of crisis and we are already getting ready for this.\nIn times such as this the spirit and compassion of our people reinstates my belief in our core philosophy of Growth with Goodness. Let all of us contribute to help our nation rise above this crisis. It may take time but there is ample optimism to show that it is possible.\nBoard And Committee Charters\nMedia Coverage\nSustainability\nExplore Investor Relations\nAny shock to a system always helps drive home some key points and what the Indian businesses have learnt over the past few years and most certainly post Covid 19 is the value of an optimal and perhaps for some sectors a conservative capital structure as well as the criticality to have systematic risk mitigation plans in place. Both optimal capital structures, and risk mitigation is a part of the maturing of the business philosophies as they grow in size and lays the foundation for stability as well as consistent value creation.\nMedia Library\nExplore Careers\n+ View All\nSiteMap\n\"Newsroom\nInvestors\n\"Investors\nAdani Foundation contributed Rs. 5 crore to the Gujarat CM-Relief Fund and Rs. 1 crore to the Maharashtra CM Relief Fund; we have also contributed to Kattupalli District Collector COVID-19 Fund and the Bhadra District Administration.\nAt the Group level, our focus is on optimising capital utilisation, redesigning the organisational structure to minimise risk in our businesses and funding operations in phases. I am happy to share that during the year, the Group has been able to bring strategic global equity partners in Adani Gas, Adani Green Energy Ltd and Adani Mumbai Electricity Ltd. The total investment is USD 1.6 bn; and will help drive future growth of our businesses. It is also pertinent to mention that AEML (part of Adani Transmission) recently completed an investment grade, USD 1 billion bond issuance, the first by a private integrated utility from India. The issue generated significant interest from international investors and was oversubscribed by 5.9 times. I must also mention here that APSEZ raised $750 million by selling overseas bonds, the proceeds from which would be used for fund expansion and further reduce the cost of debt and progressively further deleverage the balance sheet. In the preceding 12 months, the Group has successfully placed seven bonds in the international markets, totaling to 4.26 bn USD.\nWhat we must realize is that there are no absolute right or wrong ideas. What is required during an unprecedented, hard to model, crisis like Covid-19, is a Government that is willing to make decisions based on best available information at a given point of time and constantly adapting as new information becomes available. For this, the Indian Government and bureaucracy must be complimented. Countries with greater resources than ours have struggled and while our battle with the virus is far from over, I have no hesitation in stating that had the decisions that got made been delayed we could have been facing an unmitigated disaster that would not just impact India but have global ramifications. Yes, business has suffered immensely, lives and jobs have been lost, and the migrant worker crisis saddened the entire nation, but the consequences of the unknown alternates would be far grimmer. What the leaders of our nation, the doctors, the healthcare workers, the police, the army, the small street side vendors, and the citizens have done to support each other is truly what defines India and its resiliency. Add to this the fact that the Government is are now able to do direct benefits transfer as a result of the integrated approach it has built through the Jan Dhan, Aadhaar and Mobile linking systems and we start seeing the benefits of a Government that had the vision to put in place the infrastructure we need to be able to handle a crisis.\n\"About Us\nOur journey towards sustainability accelerated over the past 12 months.

India is the only major nation that is ahead of its commitments made under COP 21 at Paris in 2015. As a growing major economy, it needs to utilize all sources of energy to reach its development goals. India is expected to achieve two of the three commitments made under the Paris Agreement, viz. reducing GHG emission intensity, increasing penetration of renewables, and creating an additional carbon sink in the form of green cover, a full decade before the 2030 deadline.\nI am pleased to report that each one of our six publicly traded companies has performed well even as we started to confront the trying circumstances following the first few weeks of 2020.
