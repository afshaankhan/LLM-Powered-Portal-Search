Since DWDM by itself does not offer any way to consolidate partially filled wavelengths, this leads to a lot of bandwidth wastage.

The transport infrastructure is the key to secure the best 5G experience. It is imperative to upgrade to a high-performance and highly reliable end-to-end optical fiber network that cost-effectively fulfils end-user demands. 5G use cases such as Ultrareliable low latency communications (URLLC) and Enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) require deterministic real-time latency (end-to-end delay) for services. Each use case presents distinct challenges for 5G fronthaul performance. Mobile fronthaul effectively moves the radio elements close to the end users, plays a pivotal role in meeting these stringent latency demands.

With the launch of TJ1600S/I, the world\u2019s largest disaggregated multi-terabit Packet/OTN switch, Tejas Networks provides an alternate pathway for CSPs to scale their networks. By leveraging an innovative \u201cleaf-and-spine\u201d architecture, TJ1600S/I can seamlessly scale from 900Gbps to 48Tbps switching capacity through incremental investments in switching capacities. This \u201cpay-as-you-grow\u201d approach brings tremendous flexibility to the ordering process and network planning for telecom customers.

Since fiber penetration and right-of-way constraints are an issue in many parts of Africa, fixed wireless access (FWA) is emerging as a good alternative to fiber broadband by eliminating coverage gaps and ensuring a faster rollout of broadband services. Tejas\u2019s TJ1400 UCB (Ultra Converged Broadband) addresses this challenge effectively by replacing multiple fixed-function network elements deployed at CSP POPs (points of presence) such as FWA BBU (Baseband Unit), FTTX OLT (Optical Line Terminal), Carrier Ethernet aggregation and Optical Transport in a single universal edge/access equipment thereby delivering 50%+ savings in the total cost of network ownership. TJ1400 UCB has been further enhanced to include full-fledged 4G/LTE-based mobile broadband which can be upgraded to 5G in the future.\nOpen Access Network\nFuture Technologies\nOptical Aggregation\nPrivacy notice\nInvestors\nFacebook-f\nServices\nCookie Policy\nNetwork Management\nKey Management\nMetro Core and Backbone\nSmart and Safe City\nRural Broadband Solution\nCareers\nJuly 28, 2022\nxPON\nStrategic and Institutional Networking\nAI-ML\nBoard of Directors\nThe growing consumption of high-bandwidth applications is posing a major challenge for CSPs in Africa that are operating low-speed 10G DWDM networks. Wholesale transformation of these backbone networks to higher-capacity 100G/100G+ coherent DWDM technologies is time-consuming, expensive and potentially service-disruptive. Tejas\u2019s intelligent Alien Wavelength technology enables such TSPs to achieve a 200X growth in Metro and Backbone network capacities by transmitting 100G/100G+ waves on unused optical channels in an incumbent 10G infrastructure. State-of-the-art solutions such as those from Tejas also support advanced capabilities such as the elimination of guard bands between 10G and 100G/100G+ DWDM wavelengths in order to maximize spectral utilization. Tejas\u2019s intelligent alien wavelength offering is also bundled with sophisticated software toolkits that help operators run pre-deployment simulations and conduct comprehensive physical layer studies prior to actual rollout, thereby reducing network downtime, optimizing field engineer\u2019s efforts and minimizing the overall cost and time of deployment. Further, by combining with \u201csub-lambda\u201d grooming at the OTN layer, bandwidth efficiency can be significantly increased thereby reducing the overall cost per bit of the network.\nEvents\nSwitching and Routing\nYoutube\nWireless Core\nApplications\nResidential and Business Broadband\nAbout Us\nDirect to Mobile\n\u00a92024 Tejas Networks All rights reserved\nNewsroom\nTejas Networks is India\u2019s largest R&D-driven telecom equipment company, which successfully grew from being a startup to being India\u2019s first deep-technology product company to be publicly listed.

NMS with multi-technology support (SDH, DWDM, PTN, Ethernet/IP and OTN), cross-technology/vendor agnostic with centralized/single pane control, and simplified views that support advanced forensics-based simultaneous SLA confirmation for multiple flows are some of the noted developments in this space.\nEvents\nSwitching and Routing\nYoutube\nThe high reliance on data has made telecom networks mission-critical and led to a sharp rise in data traffic across the world. With homes morphing into workplaces, entertainment zones, shopping malls, social networking and schools, there\u2019s been a marked increase in data consumption and greater use of high-speed broadband, both mobile and fixed. In India, data shared by the telecom regulator highlights how the average monthly wireless data consumption per user is expected to go up by around 15 per cent in the next six months. That in the first week of lockdown last year, social media usage was up by 87 per cent and internet browsing was up by 72 per cent may help put the data demand uptick in perspective. Capacity demand during that one week is what we saw in the whole of the previous year!\nWireless Core\nEven as businesses stabilize and the economy begins to revive, industry analysts believe that the current network infrastructure isn\u2019t really best equipped to deal with any sudden nation-wide spikes in web traffic due to low fiberisation. A higher spending in Optical and xPON (for FTTX) led by an increase in residential bandwidth demand and significant bandwidth upgrades, therefore, can be expected in access and backbone networks, even as fiberisation continue to increase. In addition, telcos are expected to continue investing in their existing 4G networks even as they prepare their networks for 5G.\nApplications\nResidential and Business Broadband\nAbout Us\nRemote NOC Management and Unified NMS\nDirect to Mobile\nBlurb: The decadal shift in the technological landscape is transforming the services landscape, paving the way for next-generation services and resilient networks operations in the post Covid era.\n\u00a92024 Tejas Networks All rights reserved\nNewsroom\nIP/ MPLS\nDesigned by Verbinden Communication\nORAN\nThe pandemic has reset the way we live, work and do business, and not surprisingly, some of these changes are here to stay.

To de-risk our business, we aim to increase our international revenue contribution to at least 50% of our total revenues in the medium term. We are continuing to make investments in international sales and recently we have hired a strong sales leader in US, which is expected to be a key market for us.\u201d The macro factors driving our business continue to be robust, as increased use of data by consumers, businesses and governments and the rollout of 5G networks is resulting in an increased demand for our optical transmission equipment.\nTejas Networks [BSE: 540595, NSE: TEJASNET] today announced that it has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Bharat Electronics Limited (BSE: 500049, NSE: BEL), India\u2019s premier defence solution provider. The MoU envisages strategic cooperation, covering the use of Tejas\u2019 optical transmission, access and data-switching products for domestic & export markets by jointly capitalising on the emerging opportunities in defence communication, strategic communication, smart city, homeland security, metro and state network projects under the \u201cMake-in-India\u201d program.\nESG\nMr. Venkatesh Gadiyar, CFO said, \u201cDuring Q2, our cash position improved by \u20b9 59 crore and our cash and cash equivalents, including investment in liquid mutual funds and deposits with financial institutions, stood at \u20b9 290 crore. During the quarter, our overall DSO marginally improved to 277 days and excluding BSNL, our DSO improved by 24 days to 173 days, as compared to June 30, 2019. We also started to receive some amount of long-overdue payments from BSNL during the quarter. We are practically debt-free and we have a strong balance sheet to support our growth plans.\u201d\nMr. Sanjay Nayak, Managing Director and CEO of Tejas Networks said, \u201cWe are honoured that Hon\u2019ble Minister Shri Ravi Shankar Prasad, has launched TJ1600S/I, our latest packet and optical switching product, at IMC today. TJ1600S/I is a revolutionary product that has been fully conceptualized, designed and made in India and can be deployed in 5G core networks, for interconnecting hyperscale data centers and to build multi-terabit backbone networks.

The weak revenue during the quarter was primarily due to steep decline in Government business. The Government business was 15% of revenues during the quarter as compared to 55% in Fiscal 2019. The decline is due to deferment of spending on Government projects and we expect to see enhanced Government spending during the second half of the fiscal year.\nNovember 26, 2019\nScroll to Top\nTejas Networks has supplied telecom equipment to all the major communication service providers, mission-critical government and defence networks.

The decline in profits is primarily due to decline in revenues, coupled with the fact that a majority of our costs such as R&D, are linked to manpower and are fixed in nature.

The weak revenue during Q4 was primarily because of operational challenges and inability to ship confirmed customer orders because of lockdown due to Covid-19 and pushout of new customer orders, which were otherwise expected.

In addition, we secured wins from multiple Tier-1 operators for our GPON-based home-broadband products.

Decline in revenues resulted in a loss before tax and before impairment of intangible assets of Rs. 56.7 crore, as compared to a profit of Rs. 37.1 crore for corresponding previous period, since a majority of costs other than cost of material, are linked to manpower and are fixed in nature. The weak revenue during Q4 was primarily because of operational challenges and inability to ship confirmed customer orders because of lockdown due to Covid-19 and pushout of new customer orders, which were otherwise expected. The company also reassessed the marketability of its intangible assets under development as well as capitalized intangible assets, and has taken a one-time impairment charge of Rs. 69.87 crore towards the accumulated costs relating to past R&D.\nX\nMr. Sanjay Nayak, Managing Director and CEO of Tejas Networks said, \u201cIndian telecom sector is undergoing major financial stress, resulting in capex reduction by all private operators. In addition, Government spending on telecom projects declined sharply during FY20, resulting in a major revenue decline for us. We have put a lot of focus to reduce our dependence on India, and our medium term goal is to get 50% of our revenues from international customers. We made significant progress during FY20 in terms of securing new international customer wins and increasing our sales investments, but we could not see the positive impact in Q4, due to pushout of orders because of COVID-19.\nNewsroom\nIP/ MPLS\nPress Release\nDesigned by Verbinden Communication\nor contact Investor Relations:\nORAN\nSDH/ SONET",

These labels identify the forwarding path to the next node, streamlining packet routing. As the packet traverses the network, each MPLS node removes the old label and replaces it with a new one based on its internal forwarding table. This process continues until the packet reaches its destination, where the final label is removed, and the original packet is delivered. As a pre-requisite, existing routing protocol (e.g., OSPF, IS-IS etc.) is used to establish reachability and distribute labels among the network nodes.\nKnow More\nRadio Access Network\nHome\n4G LTE\nQuick Links\nCarrier Ethernet\nSatcom Solutions\u200b\nContact Us\nProducts & Solutions\nBy accessing or using our website, you acknowledge that you have read, understood and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of our\nInfo@tejasnetworks.com\n.\nSubscribe for our latest news\nTejas Packet Transport Network Portfolio\nEnterprise Networking\nSenior Leadership\nAwards and Recognition\nOpen Access Network\nFuture Technologies\nPrivacy notice\nTejas Offerings \u2013 Key Highlights\nInvestors\nCentralized Network Management\nFacebook-f\nServices\nCookie Policy\nKey Management\nMetro Core and Backbone\nSmart and Safe City\nRural Broadband Solution\nCareers\nOptimal Network Utilization and TCO Optimization\nxPON\nTejas Optical Aggregation Portfolio\nStrategic and Institutional Networking\nAI-ML\nBoard of Directors\nEvents\nSwitching and Routing\nYoutube\nLayer 3 Traffic Engineered VPN\nVersatile Platforms, Designed to Handle a Wide Range of Applications and Technologies\nWireless Core\nResidential and Business Broadband\nAbout Us\nMPLS and its extension provide several advantages such as reduced latency and traffic engineering to balance loads across different paths, Quality of Service (QoS) policy implementation and simplified network management.\nScalable Convergent Network\nDirect to Mobile\n\u00a92024 Tejas Networks All rights reserved\nX\nNewsroom\nIP/ MPLS\nDesigned by Verbinden Communication\nHighly Scalable and Support to Different Types of Traffic\nORAN\nSDH/ SONET\nProducts and Resources\nTejas Networks wins Rs 696 crore order for a pan-India router network",

While initial DWDM systems were typically limited to carrying 2.5Gbps of bandwidth per wavelength, recent advances in coherent DWDM technology can deliver 100G and 100G+ bit rates per wavelength over longer distances at the lowest cost per bit. Coherent DWDM unlocks significant advantages by using advanced light manipulation techniques. It transmits data by encoding information on the amplitude, phase, and polarization of light waves. Additionally, sophisticated digital signal processing compensates for signal distortions caused by chromatic dispersion and polarization mode dispersion (CD, PMD), enabling longer reach and higher capacity. Coherent DWDM systems also support advanced Forward Error Correction (FEC) mechanisms to reduce regeneration requirements and expand transmission reach over newly laid as well as old fiber installations.\nAgree\nAwards & Recognition\nTejas Metro Core and Backbone Portfolio\nPrivacy Policy\nBest Practices at Tejas\nFixed Mobile Convergence\nFiber Broadband Access\nSkip to content\n5G NR\nOTN in Access Networks\nDWDM and OTN\n5G Access and xHaul\nRouter Bypass for Overall TCO Optimization\nIP-MPLS\nKnow More\nRadio Access Network\nHome\n4G LTE\nTejas Tech Talks | OTN Technology \u2013 Dr. Kanwar Jit Singh\nQuick Links\nCarrier Ethernet\nSatcom Solutions\u200b\nContact Us\nProducts & Solutions\nBy accessing or using our website, you acknowledge that you have read, understood and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of our\nInfo@tejasnetworks.com\n.\nSubscribe for our latest news\nEnterprise Networking\nSenior Leadership\nAwards and Recognition\nOpen Access Network\nFuture Technologies\nOptical Aggregation\nPrivacy notice\nTejas Offerings \u2013 Key Highlights\nInvestors\nFacebook-f\nServices\nCookie Policy\nOptical Transport Network (OTN) as an ITU standard (G.709), was originally designed to provide a protocol-independent wrapper of client data. In recent times, OTN is being used to perform primarily two additional functions: a) Efficient Sub-Lambda Grooming: DWDM layer is capable of handling traffic at a wavelength layer. Since DWDM by itself does not offer any way to consolidate partially filled wavelengths (e.g., loosely filled 100Gbps wavelengths) this leads to a significant bandwidth wastage. OTN solves this problem by providing sub lambda grooming through an OTN cross-connect. b) Bypass of Transit Traffic: On a cost per Gbps of switching capacity, routers tend to be much more expensive than OTN fabrics. By substituting OTN for a significant part of the switching capacity (the transit traffic), operators can reduce the overall costs significantly and save expensive router ports to reduce overall capex. Also, OTN fabrics consume less power compared to routing fabrics and traditional TDM cross-connects used to groom traffic at lower speeds such as 2 Mbps.\nNetwork Management\nKey Management\nSmart and Safe City\nRural Broadband Solution\nCareers\nHigh Capacity and Efficient Optical Transport\nODUFlex for Efficient Bandwidth use\nxPON\nStrategic and Institutional Networking\nAI-ML\nBoard of Directors\nEvents\nSwitching and Routing\nYoutube\nGbps to Tbps Range Capacity\nWireless Core\nApplications\nResidential and Business Broadband\nAbout Us\nDirect to Mobile\n\u00a92024 Tejas Networks All rights reserved\nNewsroom\nIP/ MPLS\nDesigned by Verbinden Communication\nORAN\nOTN Cross-Connect\nHigh-capacity optical communications is a key technology advance that is driving network transformation in Core and Long-haul networks.
