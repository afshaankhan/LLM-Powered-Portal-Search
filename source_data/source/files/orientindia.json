Adversaries may target your systems with phishing attacks on individual users and malware that compromises individual devices.\nWhen a data protection solution can be deployed at the same scale as any cloud-ready application, it should be to host workloads on the cloud at a limitless scale. This means the solution protecting this workload should be able to scale up, down, and across multiple regions dynamically.\nWeb Application firewall\nIn the case of shared resources like a public cloud, you may have Service Level Agreements (SLAs) with your cloud provider that define which physical security standards will be met. For example, some public cloud providers have arrangements with government clients to restrict which personnel have access to the physical hardware.\nDid we miss your question?\nOur Multi-vendor support services involve hardware and software support through annual maintenance contracts and includes troubleshooting, repair, and maintenance services for devices and systems from multiple vendors.\nTechnical controls are the heart of hybrid cloud security. The centralized management of a hybrid cloud makes technical controls easier to implement.\nIn this case, the solution should be able to back up on-prem workloads to cloud storage in an agentless manner with auto-tiering. Also, in this case, the solution should provide smooth failover and failback capabilities between on-prem and cloud environments. Anything else defeats hybrid cloud usefulness.\nPower Apps can be used to create a wide range of applications, including data entry forms, dashboards, workflows, and mobile applications.\nEndpoint Security\nCloud, DevOps, Data Management\nOffice No 28\\2 Spencer Castle 1st Floor Spencer Road Frazer Town Bengaluru 560005\n|\nand we will get back within 24 hours.\nWeb application firewalls help protect web applications from malicious attacks and unwanted internet traffic, including bots, injection, and application-layer denial of service (DoS).

Try the Linux Unified Key Setup-on-disk (LUSK) format which can encrypt your hard drive partitions in bulk.\nAdministrative control in hybrid cloud security is implemented to account for human factors. Because hybrid cloud environments are highly connected, security is the user\u2019s responsibility.\n+91 22 4292 8888\nEndpoint security often means using software to remotely revoke access or wipe sensitive data if a user\u2019s smartphone, tablet, or computer gets lost, stolen, or hacked.\nWhen a data-protection solution is delivered as-a-service, it should offload any form of manual labor. In other words, the solution should have:\nProtect your data at rest\nBlogs\nHow can Desktop Management in the Modern Workplace improve productivity?\nBusiness analytics refers to the practice of using data and statistical methods to analyze business operations and make informed decisions.

It involves the use of specialized software and hardware to extract, transform, and load data from multiple sources into a structured data warehouse, where it can be accessed and analyzed for business intelligence purposes.\nThe bot management solution uses detection techniques such as IP rate limiting, CAPTCHA, device fingerprinting, and human interaction challenges to identify and block bad and/or suspicious bot activity from scraping your website for competitive data. At the same time, the WAF can allow legitimate bot traffic from Google, Facebook, and others to continue to access your web applications as intended.\nHardware encryption will protect the hard drive from unauthorized access. Try the trusted platform module (TPM), which is a hardware chip that stores cryptographic keys. When the TPM is enabled, the hard drive is locked until the user is able to authenticate their login.\nWhat does Orient do in managed services?\nDelivered as-a-service\nA company can prepare for cloud to cloud migration by performing a comprehensive inventory of its current infrastructure, data, and applications, identifying potential compatibility issues or data migration challenges, selecting a compatible cloud provider, and developing a migration plan that includes testing and risk management measures\nWe provide Cloud services to a wide range of industries, including Pharmaceutical, Healthcare, BFSI, ITeS, Government-PSU and more.\nHybrid clouds also depend on access control. Restrict user accounts to only the privileges they need and consider requiring two-factor authentication. Limiting access to users connected to a Virtual Private Network(VPN) can also help you maintain security standards.\nTech Support\nIndustry\nWhen a data protection solution can be deployed across clouds, no matter how deep customers get with their cloud adoption, they still need to factor in some form of fashion typically. In these cases, customers may want to leverage cloud resources purely for backup or DR purposes.\nWhen a data protection solution is purpose-built, much like the concept of purpose-built appliances, it should be tightly integrated and support the specific platform it was designed to support, in the best way possible. This ensures the best ROI of the cloud platform of choice by in turn leveraging every ounce of its functionality.\nPrivacy Policy\nHow can a company prepare for cloud to cloud migration?\nDrop us a line\nWhat is involved in Zero Touch Deployment?\nHybrid cloud security, like computer security in general, consists of three components: physical, technical, and administrative.\nInvestor\nBot Management\nHow can Orient Technologies Limited help us improve our collaboration capabilities?\nHybrid clouds offer the opportunity to reduce the potential exposure of your data.

The benefits of a managed WAF service include significant risk reduction.\nBenefits of web application firewalls\nIT Infrastructure\nAs enterprise cloud adoption grows, business-critical applications and data migrate to trusted third-party cloud service providers(CSPs). Most major CSPs offer standard cybersecurity tools with monitoring and alerting functions as part of their service offerings, but in-house information technology (IT) security staff may find these tools do not provide enough coverage, meaning there are cybersecurity gaps between what is offered in the CSP\u2019s tools and what the enterprise requires because no organization or CSP can eliminate all security threats and vulnerabilities, business leaders must balance the benefits of adopting cloud services with the level of data security risk their organizations are willing to take.\nWeb application firewalls help protect applications deployed in the public cloud, on-premises, and in multi-cloud environments with access controls based on geolocation data, whitelisted-, and blacklisted IP addresses, Hypertext Transfer Protocol Uniform Resource Locator (HTTP URL), HTTP header.\nYou can reach out to us by phone, email, or by filling out the opt-in form on our website.

Here, the consumer VPCs overlap with each other and with the provider \u2013 the worst-case scenario.\nData Centre Solutions\nInstagram\nA company can ensure data security during cloud to cloud migration by using encryption and secure transfer protocols, implementing access controls and user authentication measures, and performing regular security audits and risk assessments.\n25-April-2023\nCloud Services\nAn Annual Maintenance Contract (AMC) is an agreement between a customer and a service provider for the provision of ongoing maintenance and support services for a specified period. An AMC typically covers hardware and software maintenance, repair, and replacement services for IT systems, with the aim of ensuring maximum uptime and minimizing downtime.\nLinkedIn\nYou may have an application that\u2019s broken into different tiers \u2013 a front-end that responds to users or other application requests; and then one or more \u201cback-end\u201d tiers comprising middleware, databases, caches, and so on. In this environment, you can choose to have a set of front-end subnets that have non-overlapping IP addresses while the back-end subnets do overlap with other applications.\nA common situation we see in customer networks is when there are resources with overlapping IP address ranges that must communicate with each other. Frequently this occurs when companies are acquired and have used the same private (RFC1918) address ranges. However, it can also occur when a service provider with a unique IP range must provide access to two different customers that each have the same IP range.\nIn general, we strongly recommend renumbering overlapping networks where possible as it is cheaper and easier in the long term.\nOrient Technologies Limited offers a range of active networking components such as, switches, routers, SD-WAN, and WI-FI.\nHow can Mobile Device Management improve security?\ncomponents in another subnet using a non-reachable IP address range.\nCareers\nHow can Orient Technologies Limited help us migrate our existing applications and data to the cloud?\nBSFI\nHow can Orient Technologies Limited help us optimize our compute and storage infrastructure?\nOffice:\nNetwork overlaps can also occur unintentionally. Make sure that you check the documentation of services and applications when building your VPCs to avoid conflicts with predefined IP addresses.\nas seen for Customer C in the diagram. Customer C also has a different IP range in the VPN VPC \u2013 perhaps because 172.16.0.0/16 was already in use in their network so the intermediate network must be different for them. This isn\u2019t an issue, as the IP address range in that VPC only needs to not conflict with anything in the networks that Customer C uses. Therefore, there\u2019s a huge range of flexibility in what can be chosen.\nDevice as a Service can provide organizations with predictable costs, simplified procurement and deployment processes, and access to the latest technology and support services.\nX\n\u00b7 Complex troubleshooting: When things go wrong, trying to figure out what\u2019s happening; where it\u2019s happening; and what to do about it, is complex enough without having to deal with overlapping IP addresses. This can all be confusing and mean that troubleshooting takes much longer than it otherwise could.\nZero Touch Deployment involves pre-configuring devices with settings, applications, and other configurations, and then using tools and automation to deploy the devices to end-users without requiring any manual intervention.\ninquiry@orientindia.net\nManufacturing\nTalk to us\n\u200d\n711 7th Floor, Shiromani Complex, opp Ocean Park, Nehru nagar Satelite Post Office Ahmedabad 380015\nWhat does Orient do in multi-vendor support?\nOption 1: Renumber IP networks\nOur Multi-vendor support services involve hardware and software support through annual maintenance contracts and includes troubleshooting, repair, and maintenance services for devices and systems from multiple vendors.\nDid we miss your question?\nPower Apps can be used to create a wide range of applications, including data entry forms, dashboards, workflows, and mobile applications.\nCloud, DevOps, Data Management\nIn this case, managing instances in the back-end subnets would need to be done using SSM or bastion hosts in the front-end subnets. If application deployment was automated then there would be no need for human management of those hosts. This is a far more desirable outcome.\nOffice No 28\\2 Spencer Castle 1st Floor Spencer Road Frazer Town Bengaluru 560005\n|\nand we will get back within 24 hours.\nHealth Care\nOnly configured TCP ports are allowed between the consumer and provider. This makes sure that the consumer only has access to specific resources in the provider VPC and nothing else.\nNote that there\u2019s a cost for Private Link as per Aws. Some applications may not work with this solution as applications must present as a single TCP port. If you have an application that uses UDP or has multiple TCP ports and the clients must maintain back-end and server affinity then Private Link isn\u2019t appropriate for you.\nOption 3: Use multiple IP addresses ranges in VPCs\nWe provide multi-vendor support, managed services, annual maintenance contract, and facility management services to a wide range of industries, including Pharmaceutical, Healthcare, BFSI, ITeS, Government-PSU and more.\nMission & Vision\nOur Teams\nDelhi Office:\nThis doesn\u2019t solve the challenge of how to administer servers that reside in the back-end subnets. One way of doing this is to place a bastion host in the front-end subnet of each VPC. This will let administrators reach the back-end subnets by using SSH or RDP to that intermediary host.\nIn Transit Gateway, a route to the front-end subnets has been added so that return traffic can be sent back to the Private NAT Gateways. Within the VPCs, traffic from the back-end subnets will be routed to the Private NAT Gateways in much the same way that Internet-facing NAT Gateway route tables operate.\nOur team of experts can analyze your current infrastructure and provide recommendations on how to optimize it for better performance, scalability, and cost-effectiveness.

It won\u2019t work in the service provider scenario above. However, if there\u2019s an opportunity to renumber the networks, then it\u2019s the best option. Although changing a network configuration isn\u2019t easy, it avoids long-term pains such as:\nRedundancy comes built into Private Link in the form of the NLB. This delivers traffic to the back-end servers and consumer VPC configuration. Moreover, you choose which subnets to place endpoints in. The following diagram shows a multi-subnet environment that would be set up across multiple availability zones.\nBlogs\nHow can Desktop Management in the Modern Workplace improve productivity?\nBusiness analytics refers to the practice of using data and statistical methods to analyze business operations and make informed decisions. This includes the use of advanced analytics techniques such as predictive modeling, data mining, and machine learning to extract insights from large and complex datasets.\nRemember that renumbering the networks that conflict is by far the best option (in terms of cost, complexity, and visibility) in the long term. For service or application providers that have no control over the networks to which they connect, Private Link is designed specifically to deal with that problem.\nEnd-User Support can include help desk services, online support resources, training and education, and on-site support services\nData warehousing is the process of collecting, storing, and managing data from various sources in a central repository. It involves the use of specialized software and hardware to extract, transform, and load data from multiple sources into a structured data warehouse, where it can be accessed and analyzed for business intelligence purposes.\nKolkata\nWhat does Orient do in managed services?\nA company can prepare for cloud to cloud migration by performing a comprehensive inventory of its current infrastructure, data, and applications, identifying potential compatibility issues or data migration challenges, selecting a compatible cloud provider, and developing a migration plan that includes testing and risk management measures\nWe provide Cloud services to a wide range of industries, including Pharmaceutical, Healthcare, BFSI, ITeS, Government-PSU and more.\nNote that the VPC IP address range is 10.0.0.0/16 but two extra subnets have been added (10.31.10.0/24 and 10.31.11.0/24) which are outside of the original VPC IP address range. A Private NAT Gateway has been added in each availability zone (note that as with Internet-facing NAT Gateways, only one is required but two are recommended for redundancy) to each of the subnets with the secondary IP address ranges. The NAT Gateways will use an IP address from that subnet to translate IP addresses of the workloads from the back-end subnets.\nTech Support\nOption 4: Hide subnets using Private Gateway\nIndustry\nFacebook\nPrivacy Policy\nThis post discusses some ways in which you can overcome this obstacle for IPv4-based networks.\nHow can a company prepare for cloud to cloud migration?\nDrop us a line\nWhat is involved in Zero Touch Deployment?\nInvestor\nHow can Orient Technologies Limited help us improve our collaboration capabilities?\nWe provide Data management services to a wide range of industries, including Pharmaceutical, Healthcare, BFSI, ITeS, Government-PSU and more.\nCorporate Office (Mumbai):\nWhat types of applications can be created using Power Apps?\nPartners:\n4th Floor 7 Kirti Bhavan 44 Sheela Vihar Colony Off Paud Road Kothrud Pune 411038\nAWS Direct Connect\n\u00b7 Compatibility issues: All the following solutions utilize Network Address Translation (NAT) in some way. Some applications won\u2019t work with NAT, and others will have limitations in how they can be used. You may not have applications today that doesn't work with NAT, but they could be deployed in your environment in the future. Renumbering completely avoids this problem.\nThe following diagram shows three application VPCs connected to Transit Gateway. Note that the VPCs have overlapping IP address ranges but different front-end subnets are advertised to Transit Gateway so that they can each be reached by end users. This requires that automatic route propagation to Transit Gateway be disabled as not all of the subnets in each VPC should be advertised.\nThe Tech Brewed\nWhat kind of active networking solutions does Orient Technologies Limited offer?\nConclusion\nIT Infrastructure\nUAE\nYou can reach out to us by phone, email, or by filling out the opt-in form on our website. Our team is always happy to discuss your needs and provide personalized recommendations to help you achieve your business goals. We understand that every business is unique, and we strive to deliver solutions that are tailored to your specific requirements.\nThe launch of more specific routing in VPCs has resolved this problem. In each front-end subnet, you can modify the VPC route table so that other 10.0.x.x networks (in this example, 10.0.20.0/23 and 10.0.30.23) are routed to Transit Gateway.\nThis is useful in an environment where you want to connect from a VPC to your on-premises networks or other VPCs, but don\u2019t want to connect directly to resources in the VPC.\nWhat are the benefits of Device as a Service?\nDownload Company Profile\nIn each consumer VPC, the Private Link endpoint appears as an Elastic Network Interface with a local IP address. In the provider, VPC, connections from the consumer VPC appear to come from a local IP address within the producer VPC. The underlying Hyperplane service is performing a double-sided NAT operation to make Private Link work.\nWhat kind of networking and content delivery solutions does Orient Technologies Limited offer?\nAbout Orient\nOption 2: AWS Private Link\nAmazon Elastic Compute Cloud (AmazonEC2)\nHome\nHow does Orient\u2019s facility management services benefit businesses?\nThere are added security benefits:\nWhat industries do you cater to?\nThis option lets you deploy back-end workload subnets that have thousands of IP addresses without worrying about whether those overlap with other applications. Furthermore, you can only use the minimum number of IP addresses for front-end subnets to make sure that the application is reachable from external (to the VPC) networks.\nDesktop Management in the Modern Workplace can improve productivity by providing employees with secure access to their applications and data from any device or location, and by streamlining the management and maintenance of desktop devices.\n\u00b7 Utilizing NAT also means additional management overhead: Because applications use overlapping IP addresses, firewall rules will be complex as you keep track of and update the original and NAT IP addresses that the application use.\nYes, Power BI includes collaboration and sharing features, allowing users to share reports and dashboards with others both inside and outside their organization.\nSetting up this option is straightforward, as it has no additional maintenance, is highly redundant, and is also highly scalable. Furthermore, it provides separation between the customer networks. If you\u2019re creating applications in a service provider environment, then consider architecting your solution so that Private Link can deliver this level of network flexibility for you.\n\u00b7 Increased complexity: Generally, connecting two or more networks that overlap together is difficult! In the long term, it may prove to be increasingly complex as the application landscape grows and changes or as additional networks are added.\nUntil recently, the biggest drawback to this architecture was that the applications couldn\u2019t communicate with each other, as there was no way to create a more specific route in each VPC to allow connectivity to the front-end subnet in another VPC. For example, in VPC A you couldn\u2019t create a route for 10.0.20.0/23 because it\u2019s more specific than the VPC address range.\nIn 2017 AWS launched Private Link. This is a Hyperplane-based service that makes it easy to publish an API or application endpoint between VPCs, including those that have overlapping IP address ranges. It\u2019s also ideal for service providers who must deliver connectivity to multiple customers, and thus have no control over the remote IP address range. Furthermore, it provides the same benefit to customers with complex networks where IP addresses overlap. This is by far the simplest option presented here, as it requires no change to the underlying network address scheme.\nOrient Technologies Limited offers a wide range of compute and storage solutions, including virtualization, servers, storage, HCI, Backup and more.\nOur Clients\nAviation",
