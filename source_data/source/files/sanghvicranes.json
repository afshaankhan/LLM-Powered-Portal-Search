Asaoti Orbital Rail corridor from Palwal to Sonipat is one of the busiest and largest railroad corridors in India. The maximum time that the railroad authority could halt train traffic at this junction was as close as 4hrs. SML, submitted the design plan a few months before so that all on-site teams could know the lifting movements. SML used their two DemagCC2800-1 (SSL and SH/LH configuration) in a tandem lift to erect a 106MT ROB Girder. Although there was a time constraint, we did not overlook even a single safety parameter. In the 4hours check, the girder was placed and fixed successfully.\nNews & Events\nAll Rights Reserved.\nCareers\nAwards & Recognition\nSitemap\nEmployee Engagement\nLocate us\nSML carried out a tandem lift operation of two downcomer ducts using LR1750 (SLDB Configuration) to reach the elevation height of 44mtr in a Steel plant at Angul(IN). The Downcomer Ducts were weighing 250 & 100MT respectively. The workspace was very confined for the crane to lift the load in the service radius. In response, SML's team of experts reeved the 100MT load from an identified point for safer and faster erection, so that it could be taken to the furnace conveniently. With tremendous coordination with our lifting partner, downcomer ducts were successfully installed within the stipulated timeframe.\nBusiness Philosophy\n.\nWeb Design Company\nConcerned person:\nQuick Links\n|\nNotifications\nSearch\nPetrochemical\nCement Sector\nPower Plant\nEmployee login\n\u00a9 Copyrights 2024\nLeadership Team\nVision Mission Values\nInvestor Information\nRegulation 62 disclosures\nContact Us\nPast Projects\nCSR\nSteel Sector\n- Graphinet\nBygari Umamahesh\nA cyclone weighing 25MT had to be lifted in the vertical position to make it to the elevation height of 150m was the biggest ever vertical lift assignment for SML.

It was vital to maintain the stability of the crane as there were frequent encounters of heavy wind gusts.

However, there is a lot of planning & coordination required at the back. A fabricated ROB erection was pre-scheduled at Mumbai-Baroda Expressway amidst the lockdown time in the year 2020. SML deployed 2x 400MT LR1400-1crawler cranes to lift 165 MT girder erection. SML has widespread experience in erecting bridges and heavy infrastructures across the nation.
