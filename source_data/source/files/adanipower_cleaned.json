    "https://www.adanipower.com/operational-power-plants/mundra-gujarat": "Adani Power's Mundra plant is India's largest thermal power plant (TPP) and sets global benchmarks for power producers in terms of size, efficiency, and sustainability. The plant has a capacity of 4620 MW, comprising 9 units with 4 units of 330 MW and 5 units of 660 MW. The 330 MW units are based on subcritical technology and the 660 MW units are based on supercritical technology. The plant is located on a very optimized layout of 734 acres alongside auxiliaries like cooling towers, a 47 MLD desalination plant, and a flue gas desulfurization plant. Adani Power constructed two power lines to help state and regional utilities evacuate electricity from the plant and into the grid. These include a 433 km, 400 KV transmission line to transmit 1000 MW from Mundra to Dehegam in Gujarat and a 989 km, 500 KV high-voltage direct current (HVDC) bipole line with the capacity to transmit 2500 MW from Mundra to Mohindergarh in the northern state of Haryana. The latter is the first and longest HVDC system by a private player in India. Adani Power created history by synchronizing the first super-critical technology-based 660 MW generating unit at Mundra. This is the first super-critical generating unit in India. The Mundra power project is also the fastest project implementation ever by any power developer in the country with a record completion of inception to synchronization within 36 months. Phase III of the Mundra project, which is based on supercritical technology, has received a 'Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) Project' certification from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). This is the world's first thermal project based on supercritical technology to get registered as a CDM Project under UNFCCC. The plant is located in the Kutch district in Taluka Mundra of Gujarat, comprising the villages of Vandh, Tunda & Siracha and is about 61 kms south of Bhuj City in Gujarat State, India. The plant is near National Highway 8A and adjacent to the sea. Kutch is a growing economic and industrial hub in one of India's fastest-growing states - Gujarat. Kutch is a mineral-rich region with a large reserve of Lignite, Bauxite, and Gypsum among other minerals. APL, Mundra which is located in APSEZ, (Adani Port and Special Economic Zone). The site of Mundra SEZ is located in the district of Kuchchh, bordered by the northern coastline of the Gulf of Kutch. The Gandhidham railway station is located 50 km away. Mandavi airstrip (about 30 km), Kandla airstrip (about 45 km), and Bhuj Airport (about 70 km) are the airstrips/airports in the vicinity. Mundra is India's largest TPP to function off a sea-water based closed-cycle induced draft circulating cooling water system. The system draws on seawater that is recycled up to 4 times, conserving water & requiring a smaller discharge pipeline into the sea than an open-circuit cooling system. Adani Power established and commissioned an Ash bagging unit to achieve 100% Fly Ash utilization. To ensure 100% utilization of Fly Ash, Adani Power established a fine Ash bagging unit at Mundra for bagging and disposal of fly ash generated due to its process. Each machine has an operational capacity of 18 TPH and the unit operates three such machines giving it a total capacity of 54 TPH. The fuel requirement of the plant is met majorly through sourcing of imported coal. It also has an operational Fuel Supply Agreement of 6.405 MTPA with subsidiaries of Coal India Ltd. APL's Mundra plant has long-term PPAs with Gujarat and Haryana State. Units 5 of Mundra TPP (660MW): Supercritical unit synchronized within 36 months from the inception, fastest implementation in the world. Mundra supercritical units 6 & 9 achieved synchronization from boiler light up in less than 3.5 months. Mundra unit 3, 5 & 9 i.e three units at a single location achieved full load operation from synchronization in less than 4 days. 2 supercritical units (Unit-8 and Unit-9 of Mundra TPP) completed the steam blowing within 2 days from boiler light up."
